# MainRepository
This is my first repository, which will be used for testing and learning. 
.
As I'm currently assembling knowledge and experimenting with simple projects to develop my skills,
the repository name will be kept as "MainRepository", for organizational purposes.
.
Other than this repository, I'll be keeping another, also public, serving as a portfolio.
.
This way I can separate things and keep them organized and labeled.
