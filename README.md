# MainRepository
<h1>About my first repository</h1>
<br>
<p>This is my first repository, which will be used for testing and learning.</p>
<br>
<p>As I'm currently assembling knowledge and experimenting with simple projects to develop my skills,<br>the repository name will be kept as "MainRepository", for organizational purposes. </p>
<p>Other than this repository, I'll be keeping another, also public, serving as a portfolio.</p>
<p>This way I can separate things and keep them organized and labeled.</p>
